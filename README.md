# Peegle Game

This is a second-year undergraduate computer science project developed by a team of 5 students.  
The objective was to recreate a version of the game **Peggle** using Java.

## My Contribution

I was responsible for:
- Designing and implementing the main **menu interface**
- Developing the **physics system** for the ball, including:
  - Rebounds
  - Objects
  - Bounces
  - Scoring system

## How to Run the Game

Make sure you are in the root directory of the project, then run:

```bash
javac.exe ./Vue/Controleur.java
java Vue.Controleur
